# Inventory UI Implementation Plan

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Extract constants for repeated values (e.g., dialog widths, colors).
- [x] Create helper functions for common operations like creating form fields, handling date pickers, and validating inputs.
- [ ] Refactor open_add_item_dialog and open_edit_item_dialog to reduce duplication by using shared components.
- [ ] Break down create_inventory_tab into smaller, focused functions (e.g., separate filter buttons, table setup).
- [ ] Add docstrings to functions for better documentation.
- [ ] Improve variable naming and remove unused code if any.
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting and indentation.
- [ ] Test the inventory UI to ensure all features (add, edit, delete, filter, search) work correctly.
- [ ] Run the application and verify no runtime errors.

## Implementation Steps
1. Extract constants and create helper functions.
2. Refactor add and edit dialogs to use shared components.
3. Break down create_inventory_tab into smaller functions.
4. Add docstrings and improve variable naming.
5. Format and clean up the code.
6. Test all functionalities.
7. Final review and cleanup.
